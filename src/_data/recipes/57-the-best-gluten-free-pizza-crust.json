Finish by picking up the container and vigorously shaking until the flours are completely blended.","The ingredients must be very well mixed, otherwise, the xanthan gum will not be evenly distributed and your baked or fried goods will be inconsistent. ","* Do not substitute with sweet white rice flour.","** Do not substitute with potato flour.","*** Psyllium can be used as a substitute for xanthan gum only if the dough is to be used in recipes that are baked in a loaf pan.Psyllium causes the dough to become crumbly after refrigeration. ","If you’re measuring using U.S. cup-measures, be sure to pack the flour tightly into the cup, as if you were measuring brown sugar.","Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, potato starch, xanthan gum, yeast, salt, and sugar in a 5-quart bowl or the large bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer.","Combine the liquid ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and add the mixture to the dry ingredients.Mix well using a wooden spoon or a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, until all of the dry ingredients are well incorporated.","Cover (not airtight) and allow to rest at room temperature until the dough rises, approximately 2 hours.","The dough can be used immediately after the initial rise, though it is easier to handle when cold.Refrigerate in a lidded (not airtight) container and use over the next 5 days. Or store the dough for up to 2 weeks in 1/2-pound portions in the freezer then thaw in the refrigerator overnight before use.","**** If replacing xanthan gum with ground psyllium husk, double the quantity.","Preheat a baking stone (or heavy-duty baking sheet) to your oven's highest temperature at 500°F to 550°F, placing the stone near the bottom of the oven to help crisp the bottom crust without burning the cheese.Most stones will be hot enough in 20 to 30 minutes.","Prepare and measure all toppings in advance.","Brush a piece of parchment paper with a teaspoon of olive oil in a 10-inch circle.Dust the surface of the prepared dough with gluten-free flour and pull off a 6-ounce piece.Quickly pat into a ball on the prepared parchment paper and drizzle with more oil.Cover with a piece of plastic wrap or another piece of parchment paper.Press with your fingers or roll out to form a 10-inch circle.Check occasionally to be sure the dough is not sticking to the top layer.If it is, gently peel back the paper or wrap and drizzle a tiny bit more olive oil.","Once the dough is the right size (keep in mind that it doesn't have to be perfect - rustic is good) remove the top layer of paper or plastic wrap.Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, using the back of a spoon or a pastry brush.Scatter the torn mozzarella and basil over the surface and give it a light sprinkling of coarse salt.","Slide the pizza into the oven, along with the bottom layer of parchment paper, onto the preheated stone or pan.For the crispiest crust, carefully slide the parchment paper out from under the pizza once it's set, about 5 minutes into the baking.","Check for doneness in 8 to 10 minutes.The time will vary depending on your pizza's thickness and your oven's temperature.When ready, remove from the oven and let the pizza cool slightly on a rack to allow the cheese to set before serving.Top with additional fresh basil and enjoy."],"tags":[],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"","total":""},"servings":null,"image":"https://i2.wp.com/ahintofrosemary.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_1090.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1","slug":"57-the-best-gluten-free-pizza-crust.json","url":"http://ahintofrosemary.com/recipes/the-best-gluten-free-pizza-crust/"}
