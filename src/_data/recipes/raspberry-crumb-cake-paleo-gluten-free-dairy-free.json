Chill in the refrigerator while you prepare the cake batter.","Preheat your oven to 350° F and place an oven rack in the middle of the oven. Line an 8 x 8” square baking pan with parchment paper on the bottom and sides, for easy removal.","In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, lemon juice and zest, coconut oil or ghee, vanilla and almond extract, and sugar. In a separate bowl, combine the almond flour, baking soda and salt.","Stir the dry mixture into the wet until well combined and smooth. Fold in half the raspberries.","Using a silicone spatula, transfer cake batter into the parchment lined cake pan and smooth out evenly. Sprinkle the remaining raspberries on top, then sprinkle all the crumb topping over the raspberries to evenly cover.","Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted near the center of the cake comes out with a few crumbs.","Place the cake pan on a wire rack to allow it to cool in the pan for at least 15 minutes. Use the parchment overhang to remove the cake from the pan to continue cooling on the wire rack.","While the cake cools, make the glaze. Combine the powdered sugar of choice with 1 1/2 Tbsp of almond milk and the vanilla, adding drop by drop more almond milk if needed to get a drizzly consistency.Hint - replace the almond milk with lemon and omit the vanilla for a lemon glaze.","Drizzle the glaze over the partially cooled or cooled cake as desired. Serve cake either slightly warm or at room temperature.
