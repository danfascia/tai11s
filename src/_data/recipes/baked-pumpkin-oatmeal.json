  "ingredients": [
    "1 can (15 Oz. Size) Pumpkin Puree",
    "3 c. Old Fashioned Oats",
    "3/4 c. Packed Light Brown Sugar",
    "1 tsp. Baking Powder",
    "3/4 tsp. Fine Sea Salt",
    "1 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "At least 30 minutes before making the oatmeal (and up to the day before), line a mesh sieve with cheesecloth. Place pumpkin puree inside and let drain. Press the pumpkin occasionally with a spoon as it drains.",
    "Grease an 11x7-inch pan. Preheat oven to 350ÂºF.",
    "Stir oats, sugar, baking powder, salt, and spices. Squeeze cheesecloth to remove excess pumpkin water and place 3/4 cup strained pumpkin in another bowl. Add milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla to the pumpkin and whisk until smooth.",
    "Stir both mixtures together until combined. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 35 minutes or until oatmeal is firm and resembles a snack cake.",
    "Cut into pieces and serve warm with a dollop of Greek yogurt and sprinkle of cinnamon-sugar.",
    "Leftovers may be covered and rewarmed in the microwave. For one piece, 40 seconds at 80% power is sufficient. Try it cold or room temperature on day two as well!"
