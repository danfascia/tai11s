If the ribs still have a membrane, slide a table knife under the silver skin of the ribs. Use a paper towel to pull the membrane carefully off.","Place ribs in a shallow baking dish and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Bake for 15 minutes and then turn over and bake for 15 more minutes. Drain fat. Note: You can skip this step if you don't want to render the fat off","In a medium bowl combine BBQ sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire, oregano, and liquid smoke and hot sauce if desired.","SLOW COOKER: Place ribs in a large slow cooker (at least 6 quart). I curled mine around but you can cut them in half if you need to. Pour sauce on top and cook on low for 6-8 hours or until tender. INSTANT POT: Place ribs in instant pot and pour sauce on top. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes. Let it naturally release the pressure.","If you want to carmelize your bbq sauce put them back in the oven and broil for 5 minutes to carmelize the sauce. Totally your preference though."],"tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10","cook":"","total":"10"},"servings":null,"image":"","Image":"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20300'%3E%3C/svg%3E","url":"https://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com/slow-cooker-barbecue-ribs/"}
