{"name":"Mini Dutch Baby Pancakes","ingredients":["Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and remove any racks above it. Place a standard (12-well) muffin pan on the rack, and heat the oven to 425ºF. ","Place 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup whole or 2% milk, 4 large eggs, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a blender or food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Blend for 1 minute — it will be very liquidy. Let the batter rest in the blender or processor for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cut 6 tablespoons unsalted butter into 12 pieces. ","Carefully remove the preheated muffin pan from the oven. Add 1 piece of butter to each well. Pour the batter into the wells, about 1/3 cup per well (don’t worry if the butter isn’t completely melted). ","Bake until the Dutch babies are puffed and lightly golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool for 1 minute before dusting with powdered sugar or filling with jam before serving.
