Add the flour gradually until a soft dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. The exact flour amount will vary so go by the touch and feel of the dough versus the exact cup measurements in the recipe. The dough should be soft and smooth (not leaving a residue on your fingers but not super stiff, either).","Knead the dough for 2-3 minutes (more like 5-6 minutes if kneading by hand or if using whole wheat flour).","Let the dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Shape the dough into pizza(s), spread with sauce and toppings, and bake at 475 or 500 degrees on a preheated pizza stone or on a lightly greased baking sheet for 8-10 minutes (for an in-depth look at baking methods, here is a great tutorial)."],"tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes","cook":"","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"20 minutes"},"servings":"1 large or 2 medium pizzas","image":"https://www.melskitchencafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/fast-pizza-dough3.jpg"}
