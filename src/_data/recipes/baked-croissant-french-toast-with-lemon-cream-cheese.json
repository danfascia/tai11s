Set aside.","In the bowl of stand mixer, beat together the cream cheese, zest of one lemon, strained juice of one lemon, and 1/2 cup powdered sugar.","Spread the cream cheese mixture over each half of the croissants and then put the tops and bottoms back together. Arrange the pieces evenly in a baking dish (mine is about a 5x9).","In the same bowl that had the cream cheese mixture (no need to wash it out first), whisk together the eggs, milk, juice and zest from the second lemon, and remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar. Pour over the croissants and cover with foil.","Refrigerate overnight. In the morning, preheat the oven to 350. Bake covered for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 20 minutes or until the croissants are golden brown.","Let stand for 5-10 minutes before serving, and top with strawberry sauce.","To make strawberry sauce, combine the strawberries, water, and sugar in saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low and let cook 10-15 minutes until the strawberries are falling apart and the liquid is thickening. Add more sugar to taste if desired."],"tags":[],"time":{"prep":"20","cook":"50","total":"10"},"servings":null,"image":"","Image":"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E","url":"https://everyday-reading.com/croissant-french-toast/"}
